# InterpretML-Model-Interpretability-in-Rice-Classification
InterpretML: A repository showcasing model interpretability techniques for rice classification, using linear, tree-based, and AutoML models. Gain insights into prediction factors through SHAP analysis and PDP plots, promoting transparency and trust in machine learning.

## Model Interpretability
Model interpretability refers to the understanding and explanation of how a machine learning model makes predictions or decisions. It involves gaining insights into the factors and features that influence the model's output. Interpretability is crucial for building trust in machine learning models, especially in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal systems.

Interpretability methods can be broadly categorized into two types: global interpretability and local interpretability. Global interpretability focuses on understanding the overall behavior and decision-making process of a model, while local interpretability aims to explain individual predictions.

## Code Explanation
The code provided demonstrates the use of different models (linear, tree-based, and AutoML) for a rice classification problem and showcases various techniques for model interpretability.

The code utilizes various Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib, shap, and H2O for data processing, modeling, and interpretability.

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the environment.

It then imports the data from a CSV file using pandas and performs data preprocessing steps like dropping unnecessary columns and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Three different models are fitted to the data:

1. Logistic Regression (RidgeClassifier)
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. AutoML (using the H2O library)

For each model, interpretability techniques are applied:

## Linear Regression (Ridge Classifier):

- The code calculates the mean absolute error (MAE) for the training and testing sets.
- It retrieves the regression coefficients and visualizes them using a bar plot, showing the importance of each predictor.

## Decision Tree:

- The code calculates the MAE for the training and testing sets.
- It visualizes the decision tree using the graphviz library, showing the nodes and splits.

## AutoML:

- The code sets up the H2O AutoML and trains multiple models.
- It selects the best model and retrieves it for further analysis.

The code then applies SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis on the models:

- For the linear model, it uses the shap.LinearExplainer to calculate SHAP values and visualizes them using force plots and summary plots.
- For the decision tree model, it uses the shap.TreeExplainer to calculate SHAP values and visualizes them using force plots and summary plots.

Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) are also generated for the linear model and decision tree model to interpret feature importance and effects.

Finally, the code concludes by mentioning the advantages of using SHAP values for model interpretability and the limitations of PDP plots for complex models.

Note that the code includes additional sections related to installing libraries and setting up the environment in a specific platform (Colab) that may not be relevant for all environments.

The code provides a practical example of applying various interpretability techniques to different types of models and can serve as a reference for understanding and interpreting machine learning models.
